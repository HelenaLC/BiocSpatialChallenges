# Abstract

`SpatialDE` by [Svensson et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4636) is a method to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression variation from spatially resolved transcriptomics data. However, the method is currently only implemented as a Python package (see https://github.com/Teichlab/SpatialDE).

# Targets

- implement `SpatialDE` in R for the `SpatialExperiment` class, *from scratch*  
or using `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("reticulate")` to wrap around the original Python implementation
- the resulting function(s) could become part of https://github.com/lmweber/spatzli
