# Abstract

With newly developed Bioc infrastructure for spatially resolved data in place, namely, the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SpatialExperiment")`, there's a need to support flexible (and pretty!) visualization. To this end, we hope to develop (and, in the future, build on) the `ggspatial` package to provide a visualization suite for the `SpatialExperiment` class and its friends. 

# Targets

The package should support, but needn't be limited to, the following

- coloring by assay data (e.g. feature expression)
- coloring by observation metadata (e.g. sample, total counts)
- control over whether or not to include an image layer
- plotting multiple samples and/or variables side by side
- ...
