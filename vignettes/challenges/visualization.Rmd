# Abstract

With newly developed Bioconductor infrastructure for spatially resolved transcriptomics data in place, namely, the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SpatialExperiment")`, there's a need to support flexible (and pretty!) visualization. To this end, we hope to develop (and, in the future, build on) the `ggspavis` package to provide a visualization suite for the `SpatialExperiment` class and its friends.

Currently, we have developed several set of visualization functions separately, including in the [ggspavis](https://github.com/lmweber/ggspavis) package, [spatialLIBD package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD), as well as numerous `RMarkdown` and other scripts that are not part of packages.

In this challenge, we would like to consolidate these functions to make them user-friendly and easily accessible in one place. We have set up the [ggspavis](https://github.com/lmweber/ggspavis) package for this purpose.


# Targets

The package should support, but needn't be limited to, the following:

- coloring by assay data (e.g. feature expression)
- coloring by observation metadata (e.g. sample, total counts)
- control over whether or not to include an image layer
- plotting multiple samples and/or variables side by side
- ...

Much of this functionality already exists in our various functions. However, there is significant overlap, and each of us has implemented our functions in slightly different ways. In this challenge, we will aim to find a way to best merge these in a way that is user-friendly for end users.
