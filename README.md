# Motivation

The goal of `BiocSpatialChallenges` is to host challenges contributed by and for the Bioconductor community in the context of spatially resolved data.

While infrastructure and workflows for spatial transcriptomics data analysis are already available elsewhere, we hope to develop tools that interact nicely with already existent Bioconductor infrastructure - as a community! 

# Structure

- Each challenge is a stand-alone `.Rmd` file, located in the `vignettes/challenges` directory
- Challenges are rated at one of three levels of difficulty: novice, intermedate, advanced
- Ideally, a challenge should be linked to a GitHub issue in an already existent package/repository
